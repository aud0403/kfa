/*
 * (소집) LEFT OUTER JOIN (경기) LEFT OUTER JOIN (선수경기결과) => 소집만 되는 경우가 있어 변경
 * 소집이 되어야 경기를 뛸 수 있으므로 소집이 기준 테이블이 됨
 * !!!!!!!NATIONAL_SUMMONS_PLAYER 의 PLAYER_IDX로 USRKEY 찾을 수 있지만 NULL인 경우가 있음, 운영팀에서 UPDATE 안 해주면 쿼리 수정해야함!!!!!!!
 * 기준연도는 소집되어서 출전하지 못 하는 선수가 있으므로 NATIONAL_SUMMONS_INFO에 소집일로 함.
 * 해체일은 2013년도 이전 데이터의 경우 사용하기 어려워 일괄적재를 원칙으로하고 추후 변경된다면 기준연도를 소집일과 해체일 연도가 다른 경우가 존재하여 소집일, 해체일 둘다 봐야할 것 같음
 * national_match_player_result#의 선수 position이 제대로 입력되지 않아 national_summons_player의 선수 position을 사용함
 * 대회등급을 팀등급으로 사용함
 * playng_time, player_rcord_occrrnc_time, rcord_occrrnc_addnl_time는 숫자가 아닌 값은 0으로 처리
